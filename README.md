##### Version Control
At SHA 07051e0 I encountered a problem with version control. I created a new branch gh-pages
to publish my site. As the new branch did not show in the remote version I tried to push
it to the remote and got this fatal error fatal: The current branch gh-pages has no upstream 
branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use 
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages. After using this command I tried to revert to a 
previous commit so I could get back to the starting point. However, I could not push this
because the remote was ahead.

In the end I just pulled from the remote and started again from 07051e0 but I lost some 
small updates.
