## JavaScript Calculator

A calculator web application built from vanilla JavaScropt as part of Founder's and Coders pre-course requirements.

To be submitted for review for Wednesday 26th February 2020.

### Design Requirements

The design criteria can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). 

### Design Approach

This calculator utilizes _immediate execution logic_ and an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approch.

I chose this appoach as I was interested in learning more about the class syntax and constructor functions. More specifically how they could be used as a blueprint for creating objects. 

This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw) was used as a reference for the design.

Note there are two JS files:

1. __app-class.js:__ This file uses a class function. The comments remain in the code to guide the reviewer though my thought process as I was building the application.
2. __app.constructor.js:__ Refactored code without the class syntax using constructors only. Created to illustrate difference in syntax (there isn't many).

##### Version Control
At SHA 07051e0 I encountered a problem with version control. I created a new branch gh-pages
to publish my site. As the new branch did not show in the remote version I tried to push
it to the remote and got this fatal error fatal: The current branch gh-pages has no upstream 
branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use 
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages. After using this command I tried to revert to a 
previous commit so I could get back to the starting point. However, I could not push this
because the remote was ahead.

In the end I just pulled from the remote and started again from 07051e0 but I lost some 
small updates.
